# dbug
A debugging and runtime program insight framework

The dbug system allows programmers to integrate code state statements in their code and then view the state of the code in real time or in history across multiple threads, filtered by interest, and to create breakpoints into the code based on custom state.

I've started pulling many of these concepts in to the org.observe.dbug package in ObServe instead of having its own project.  If that package ever encompasses the full scope of features that this project did, I'll likely delete this.  Regardless, this project is likely dead.
